Use this template for building basic static websites.

On the repository webpage, you can either click 
`Use this Template` which will create a new repository with

### Building and Running

To build the app, run

    $ grunt

The boilerplate also provides a development server which
could be run with

    $ grunt serve

`grunt serve` will automatically open the built page in a web 
browser and start watching for changes in any of these files.
Due to the structure of this boilerplate (namely the html
pages being copied over every build), you may need to fully 
reload the webpage a couple times for it to update with the 
changes.
